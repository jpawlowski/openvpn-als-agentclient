	The Adito Agent
</h1>
<p>
	The Adito Agent is a standalone component that is launched on a
	clients machine via the Adito web interface.
</p>
<p>
	It is responsible for the following :-
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Setting up and controlling tunnels created in Aditos
		<em>SSL-Tunnels</em> feature. Both remote and local listeners may be
		created each supporting multiple tunneled connections.
	</li>
	<li>
		Download and launching application extensions configured using
		Aditos
		<em>Network Places</em> feature. This may involve setting up a
		temporary SSL-Tunnel for use by the application.
	</li>
	<li>
		Setting up and controlling temporary tunnels for use by
		<em>Tunnel Web Forwards</em>.
		<br>
	</li>
</ul>
It has the following features :-
<br>
<ul>
	<li>
		Extendable. Agent extensions may be defined in the extension
		descriptor and download when the Agent starts up. Extensions may
		contain a Java class that is invoked at this time. This is currently
		for example by the
		<em>Drives</em> extensions that adds drive mapping capabilities to the
		agent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Debug console may be launched by user to monitor System.out and log
		output. This is helpful when troubleshooting. It must be enabled by
		passing the debug option when launching the agent.
	</li>
	<li>
		Port monitor may be launched by user to monitor currently active
		listeners and the tunnels that are travelling over them.
	</li>
</ul>
